## Best Practice Python

* Ascii Function
Return reable type any object (int, list, str...) 

* __function__
Methods with a double underscore before and after their name are considered as built-in methods. They are used by interpreters and are generally used in the implementation of overloaded operators or other built-in functionality.
__add__-> Can be overloaded for + operation
__sub__ -> Can be overloaded for - operation
