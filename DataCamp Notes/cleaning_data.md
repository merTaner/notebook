## Cleaning Data in Python
### Comparing Strings
* Minimum edit distance, least possible amount of steps needed to transition from one string to another
* The method have very different algoritm : Damerau-Levenshtein, Levenshtein, Hamming ...
* Insertion of a new character. Deletion of an existing character.
Substitution of an existing character. Transposition of two existing consecutive characters.
* Also, possible packages : nltk, thefuzz, textdistance ...

### Generating Pairs
* Genarrly we apply this method on two different dataframe.
* if the dataframs have similar string row we want connect to pairs to the rows.
* Also, record linkage is the act of linking data from different sources regarding the same entity.
